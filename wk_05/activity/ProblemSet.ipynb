    "# Problem 1\n",
    "A professor claims that students’ exam scores follow a normal distribution with a mean of 75 and a standard deviation of 10. However, an experimental teaching method is introduced, and a new class is tested. The observed sample mean is slightly lower than 75.\n",
    "- [x] Use the provided dataset of 30 exam scores from students under the new teaching method\n",
    "- [x] Compute the observed mean from the dataset\n",
    "- [ ] Generate a large number of samples (e.g., 10,000) from a normal distribution with μ = 75, σ =  10 to create the null distribution, sampling one instance at a time.\n",
    "- [ ] Store the mean of each sample to build the null distribution.\n",
    "- [ ] Convert the null distribution to a cumulative distribution function (CDF).\n",
    "- [ ] Compute the p-value as the probability of obtaining the observed mean or lower under the null distribution\n",
    "- [ ] Compare the p-value to α = 0.05 to determine whether the new method significantly lowers scores."
