# Summary Information
*This describes the data set that you are going to use and what it was used for. You may choose to list models in here that used the data described in the card. The date is also important due to how data may change over time*

*Dataset cards do not necessarily describe all of the data provided by a sponsor or for the project, but they should describe all data __used__ for the project*

| Field             | Description                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Name              |   |
| Curation Date     |   |
| Sensitivity Level |   | 
| Summary           |   |
| Source            |   |

# Card Authors
*This describes the people that contributed to creating the dataset card.*

| Name | Email |
| ---- | ---- |
| Name | name@msoe.edu |
|  |  |


# Known Sensitive Features
*This may not apply to all data sets, but this makes newcomers to the data aware of potential risks of IP exposure. For example, if you are using a dataset that has patient history information (PHI) you would not want to publicly release the data.*

| Feature Name | Sensitive Type | Risk Reduction Method |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
|  |  |  |

# Data Overview
*General description of the data set. Such as number of features, how large the files are, number of observations etc...*

| Field | Value |
| ---- | ---- |
| Storage Size |  |
| Number of Rows |  |
| Number of Features |  |
| Data Format |  |

# Numerical Features Summary
*This sections shows the summary statistics for all numerical features in the data set*

| Feature | Count | Mean | Std Dev | Min | 25% | Median | 75% | Max |
| ------- | ----- | ---- | ------- | --- | --- | ------ | --- | --- |
|         |       |      |         |     |     |        |     |     |
# Categorical Features Summary
*This sections shows the equivalent summary statistic for all categorical features in the data set*

| Feature | Unique Values | Most Common Value |
| ------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
|         |               |                   |

# Field Information
*Document the table that is encoded i.e. the table they are using to build the encoding*

| Feature Name | Data Type | Statistical Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Feature_example | int | Nominal | An example feature created for the use of the dataset card format. |

# Example Entry
*It is helpful to track a few observations that you are familiar with. Pick an "average" observations as well as a few that exhibit features or classes that you are interested in. E.g. for a cancer dataset you might choose a sample that has all of the classes that you want to predict or that shows severe progression of the disease.*

# Exploratory Charts
*Include a scatter plot matrix of all of your numeric features. Show bargraphs for your categorical features. If you know what response you are interested in, you might choose to make a plot of the first two principal components (from PCA or similar feature reduction algorithm) vs your known response or classes*

# Notable Feature Processing
*If you decide to do feature scaling or if you are doing any feature engineering, the process should go here. Remember that the mean and standard deviation of features would be important for any future applications that might use this data.
